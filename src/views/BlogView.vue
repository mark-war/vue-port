                    Mark worked for me for several years in Virtify. He was one
                    of the senior middle tier engineers who demonstrated
                    positive attitude and perseverance towards work. He showed
                    willingness to share his knowledge to other developers even
                    not within his team. Mark always strives hard to learn more
                    and accepts additional work responsibilities as needed. He
                    had made significant contributions in every project he
                    worked on as he always gives his best to get the work done
                    on time. I really treasure Mark for being part of my team
                    and I would always choose to work with him again if given
                    the chance.

                    I have known Mark since his first day at Virtify. He is very
                    passionate and dedicated to delivering high quality

                    He contributed a lot in the development of various software
                    products and was among the top developers during his tenure.
                    His strong dedication and commitment to the job made him to
                    be a senior developer in less than a year.

                    Mark takes pride of his work and makes sure that he accounts
                    for even the smallest details of every product feature he
                    works on. He is very strong on both business and data layers
                    and he can also work on presentation part of the
                    application. He usually finds and resolves bugs that are
                    hard to reproduce errors. He is very independent and learns
                    new technologies by himself. He always comes up with great
                    ideas and the best part was that he constantly shares it
                    among his peers. I vividly remember him creating the
                    database pattern for unit testing which he shared to other
                    teams as well. Mr Guerra is also a team leader. I like how
                    he works hand in hand with junior developers and show them
                    useful design patterns as well as anti-patterns. The best
                    part about Mark is that he works pretty well with others. I
                    am sure Mark will make a good impression in any company he
                    works with.
